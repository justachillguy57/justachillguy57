# Hello, I am Justachillguy57 aka Chill Guy :wave: 
I also commonly go by ghost on discord and sincostan on Steam and such. 
I am a Linux enthusiast, from India and I am one of the authours of [FrostVim](https://github.com/Frost-Vim/FrostVim).
Do not worry if the link to my neovim distribution returns a 404, for it is still in private beta.
